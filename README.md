React Typescript Web App for my study computer science module IPWA01-01 at IUBH. 
The goal was to create a web application to display and search fictitious COÂ² data. 
The app had to have a head and a footer as well as a menu that changes its orientation based on the language. As CSS framework I used Pico.css.
